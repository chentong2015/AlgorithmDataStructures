TODO. Heap堆的特征: 完全(平衡)二叉树
Heap is a Complete Binary Tree
- It is always balanced.
- It has the minimum possible height O(log(n)) for the tree
  - the children of a node at index i are nodes at indices 2*i+1 and 2*i+2.
  - the heap is filled from top to bottom, and from left to right at each layer.

TODO. Heap的分类: 看根节点是存储大值还是小值
- Min-Heap: the root of the tree is the smallest number
- Max-Heap: the root of the tree is the largest number

TODO. Heap堆的实现: PriorityQueue<E>优先级队列
- 基于特定Comparator比较器来比较元素并构成堆结构
- 基于堆结构存储计算(统计)TOP K特征的数据结果 !
