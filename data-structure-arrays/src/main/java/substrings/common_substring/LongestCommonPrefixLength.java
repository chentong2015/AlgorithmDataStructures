// Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix
// You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.
// A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits
// starting from its leftmost digit.
// For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.
//
// A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c,
// such that c is a prefix of both a and b.
// For example, 5655359 and 56554 have common prefixes 565
//
// You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y)
// Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs.
// If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.
